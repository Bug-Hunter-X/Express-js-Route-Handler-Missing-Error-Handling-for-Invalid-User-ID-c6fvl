# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid user IDs.

The `bug.js` file shows the faulty code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**
The original code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters and directly uses `parseInt` without checking if the parameter is actually a number.  If the ID is not a number, `parseInt` will return `NaN`, leading to an incorrect response or a crash.

**Solution:**
The solution adds comprehensive error handling to check if the ID is valid before attempting to access the user.

This demonstrates the importance of robust error handling in Express.js applications to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure application stability.
